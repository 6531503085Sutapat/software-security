# Worksheet 3 — Cryptography Used Correctly (and Misused) (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 3**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 A04 Cryptographic Failures · CWE-327, CWE-916, CWE-330, CWE-798
> **Signature game:** "Capture the Hash" (recover plaintext from weak hashes)

> **Ethics note:** Crack only the hashes provided in `hashes.txt` on your own machine. Password-cracking against accounts or systems you don't own is illegal. Wordlists and recovered values stay inside the lab VM.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Distinguish hashing, encryption, and encoding — and give one job each is the wrong tool for.
2. Why is a fast hash like MD5/SHA-1 a bad choice for storing passwords, and what should be used instead?
3. What is a salt, what attack does it defeat, and why must it be unique per password?
4. Why does AES-ECB leak structure, and what does an authenticated mode like AES-GCM add?
5. What's the difference between `random` and a CSPRNG (e.g. `secrets`), and where does it matter?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)
**Learning goals:** exploit four crypto misuses, then remediate them with a vetted KDF, authenticated encryption, and a CSPRNG.
**Prerequisites:** Docker (or local Python 3.12); `hashcat` or `john`; the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week03-cryptography
docker compose up           # installs pycryptodome + argon2-cffi, runs both scripts
# or locally:
pip install pycryptodome argon2-cffi
python vulnerable_crypto.py # see the md5 hash, repeated ECB blocks, 6-digit token
```
Targets: `vulnerable_crypto.py` (the misuses), `hashes.txt` (four unsalted MD5s), and `solution_skeleton.py` (the fix).

**What to submit per task:** the command/payload run + a screenshot of the result + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* see the misuse output. *Steps:* run `python vulnerable_crypto.py`; note the md5 digest, the identical ECB ciphertext blocks, and the short token. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the program output.

**Task 1 — Capture the Hash (30 min)** · *Goal:* recover the passwords. *Steps:* strip the comment lines from `hashes.txt`, then run `hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt` (or the `john --format=raw-md5` equivalent); recover all four plaintexts. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the cracked results (mask any real-looking value). Note in one line why unsalted MD5 fell so fast (CWE-916/327).

**Task 2 — ECB structure leak (20 min)** · *Goal:* prove ECB leaks. *Steps:* call `encrypt_ecb(b"A"*16 + b"A"*16)` from `vulnerable_crypto.py` and show the two 16-byte ciphertext blocks are identical; explain how this leaks plaintext structure (CWE-327). *Deliverable:* hex output highlighting the repeated block.

**Task 3 — Predictable token (15 min)** · *Goal:* show the reset token is guessable. *Steps:* call `reset_token()` repeatedly; argue why a 6-digit `random` token (10^6 space, non-CSPRNG) is brute-forceable (CWE-330). *Deliverable:* sample tokens + a one-line attack estimate.

**Task 4 — Hardcoded key (5 min)** · *Goal:* identify the key-management flaw. *Steps:* find `HARDCODED_KEY` in `vulnerable_crypto.py`; explain why shipping a key in source is CWE-798. *Deliverable:* the line + a 2-sentence mitigation.

**Task 6 — Crack the project target's hashes (25 min)** · *Goal:* apply cracking to your term project. *Steps:* **NoteVault** stores unsalted MD5 password hashes; obtain them (via the app's `/admin` once you can reach it, or from its `seed()`), and crack them with `hashcat -m 0`. *Deliverable:* the recovered password(s) + note the CWE — record this finding for your [project report](../../project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md).

**Task 7 — Password storage migration (25 min)** · *Goal:* fix it the way real apps do. *Steps:* write `store_password`/`verify_password` with **argon2id**, and a **rehash-on-login** path that upgrades a legacy MD5 record to argon2id the next time the user logs in. *Deliverable:* the code + a short note on why migration matters.

**Task 8 — Authenticated encryption round-trip (20 min)** · *Goal:* use AEAD correctly. *Steps:* encrypt+decrypt a message with **AES-GCM** using a random 12-byte nonce and a key from an env var; then flip one ciphertext byte and show decryption **fails** (tag check). *Deliverable:* the round-trip output + the tampered-fails proof.

**Task 9 — TLS in practice (15 min)** · *Goal:* read a real cert. *Steps:* run `openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | tee /tmp/tls.txt | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -subject -dates` for the cert summary, then `grep -E 'Protocol|New,' /tmp/tls.txt` for the negotiated TLS version (the version line is printed by `s_client`, not by `x509`, so the plain pipe would discard it); identify issuer, validity, and that TLS version. *Deliverable:* the cert summary + one line on what TLS protects that hashing/at-rest encryption does not.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (20 min)** · *Goal:* remediate using `solution_skeleton.py`. *Steps:* run `python solution_skeleton.py`; confirm `store_password`/`verify_password` use argon2id (auto-salted), `encrypt_gcm` uses a random 12-byte nonce + auth tag with a key from `ENC_KEY_HEX` env, and `reset_token` uses `secrets`. Map each fix to the CWE it closes. *Deliverable:* before/after table (misuse → fix → CWE closed) + screenshot of the fixed script running.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map each of the four misuses to its CWE and to OWASP A04, in one line each.
2. Name a real-world breach caused by weak password hashing or hardcoded keys, and which fix here would have prevented it.
3. Across all four fixes, which closes the largest real-world risk, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (cracked hashes + ECB/token/key proof + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (working `solution_skeleton.py` + before/after mapping) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + biggest-risk fix) | 15 |

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
